# IQUIX OG80 Wormhole Review

The OG80 – is hefty. The first thing you’ll notice about it once you open up the (very nice) box, is how weighty it is. The second thing you’ll notice about it is that profile. If you haven’t seen it already, side on, the keyboard somewhat resembles the cross-section of a high-top running shoe. Thin at the front, and curving upwards into a thick back section, where the F-keys abruptly jut out of a bulge at the back. The back of the board is a good couple of inches higher than the front. It might take some getting used to, and it definitely makes the board feel less portable. I did like how it made all the keys sit at a nice angle under my fingers though. It’s worth noting that the board is not at all adjustable, there are no feet underneath it (just small rubber pads), so if you’re unhappy with how it is angled, then there’s not much you can do about it.

I opted for the Cherry Brown variant of the board, with Cherry stabilisers and the optional LEDs. I’ve been using it solidly for about a week now, and I really like how it feels to type on. The layout is slightly non-standard. I’ve been using it with a MacBook Pro, and I’m still finding the muscle-memory for some keyboard shortcuts. The board has hot-swappable switches, which means that you can change it up pretty easily if you change your mind about the switches.

Whilst the general feel of the board is fantastic (and is helped by the weightiness), I have one minor gripe about the acoustics. I’m not sure if it’s just my board, but there’s a distinct metallic echo accompanying every keypress. I suspect it’s caused by the hollow body of the case amplifying the sound of the springs. If you’re someone who really cares about the thockiness of your board, then that echo might be off-putting. It sounds like a high-pitched dinging sound after every keypress. Perhaps there’s some way of dampening it, but I’m unsure. 

Aside from the acoustic issue, the case of the board is wonderful. It’s the kind of transparent, early 2000s smoky plastic which gives you a window into the inner workings. It’s pretty thick plastic too, and feels strong. I’m a fairly forceful typer and I never felt any flex or give from the case. The keycaps are nice too – grey with mint highlights. Just neutral enough for most desk setups, but still classy and not too attention grabbing, unless you switch the LEDs on. The combination of transparent case and LEDs is beautiful by the way. The LEDs are very bright and they diffuse nicely through the smoky plastic. You can modify the patterns and colours of the LEDs through various combination of the function modifier and page up and down keys. It’s worth noting that because of the strong green of the accent keycaps, some LED combinations will clash horribly, so bear that in mind. Aside from the LEDs under each key, there’s a big vertical status indicator, which is used for caps lock and indicating Bluetooth connectivity.

I’ve been using the keyboard in an entirely wired configuration. It comes with a wireless dongle which rests in a slot in the back of the case when not in use, but I haven’t had a reason to try to use it wirelessly yet. The board also comes with a couple of accessories – a USB C to A connector, and a keycap puller. It doesn’t really come with much in the way of a manual though, so setting up the wireless configuration is a bit of a mystery so far to me.

Pros: 
-	Great construction
-	Great typing feel
-	Interesting design
-	LEDs are beautiful (although note that they’re an optional extra and that variant costs a little more)
Cons:
-	Layout takes some getting used to (and I don’t know if it can be adapted to non-standard layouts like Colemak)
-	Weird dinging echo sound
Mixed:
-	The weight makes it difficult to recommend as a portable board, but if you’re looking for something that will mostly live on your desk then it’s great.
Overall, a great board 8/10
